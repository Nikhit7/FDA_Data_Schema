# FDA_Data_Schema
The FDA Fears dataset is an open source dataset available here, https://fis.fda.gov/extensions/FPD-QDE-FAERS/FPD-QDE-FAERS.html.
The dataset is huge and all the tables are created and joined according to their respectoive joins referring to the ER Diagram. 
The queries are generated and the integrety of the results is verified using a dummy database. 
There is also a Jupyter file which is a script that extracts data quaterly and some useful knowledge is obtained using the queries generated. The phython file makes the extraction faster and query run time is increased. 
The final report and presentation of findings during the project are also attached.
